        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I have some prior experience in HTML and CSS from the Udemy courses. However, they are from a while back and pretty much are not updated to today’s standards. Therefore, I signed up with TeamTreeHouse to brush up on my skills and learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So far, it has been a great experience and seeing websites come to life from nothing, to me is exciting and I can proudly say that, I finally found a career that I will enjoy.</p>
        <p>I like to learn and try new things whether its language, food, or skills. I believe it’s a great conversation starter with strangers and it help’s to break ice faster.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites with animations, fluitidy and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>FullStack</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d like to work for a employer that cares about the experience of the viewer. A “woah-cool” factor when the viewer visits the website.</p>
